# Smart Posture Detector

**Smart Posture Detector** is a real-time web application that detects a person’s posture using a webcam. It uses **p5.js** for visualization and **ml5.js (PoseNet)** for body pose detection. The app can be extended to give feedback about good or bad posture, helping users maintain ergonomic posture while sitting or standing.
